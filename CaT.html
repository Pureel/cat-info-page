        <header><h1>What Cats Are</h1></header>
        <p>Cats <code>(Felis catus)</code> are small carnivorous mammals that have been companions to humans for thousands of years. Known for their independence, agility, and unique personalities, they are one of the most popular pets worldwide. Cats have strong hunting instincts, which is why they often chase small moving objects, even when they are well-fed. They communicate through body language, vocalizations like meows and purrs, and scent marking.</p>
        <p>Cats can adapt to different living conditions, from rural farms to small city apartments, making them versatile and resilient animals.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Likes">
        <header><h1>Likes</h1></header>
        <p>Cats enjoy warm and cozy places where they can rest, such as sunny windowsills or soft blankets. They are playful creatures and like toys that mimic prey, such as feather wands, small balls, and string-like objects. Many cats love to climb or perch in high places where they can observe their surroundings. Gentle petting, especially on the head and chin, is often appreciated. Some cats also enjoy interactive feeding games that allow them to use their hunting skills.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Dislikes">

       <header><h1>Habitat</h1></header>
        <p>In the wild, cats can be found in diverse habitats, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and urban areas. Their natural adaptability allows them to survive in both warm and cold environments. Domesticated cats need safe shelter, access to fresh water, and a steady food supply.</p>
        <p>While many cats live entirely indoors for safety, others are allowed limited outdoor time under supervision or in secure enclosures.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Natural_Behaviours">
        <header><h1>Natural Behaviours</h1></header>
        <p>Cats display a variety of natural behaviors that come from their wild ancestors. They are skilled hunters, using stealth and patience to stalk prey. Scratching is used to mark territory and maintain healthy claws. Grooming is an important daily activity for cleanliness and scent maintenance.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Domestication">
        <header><h1>Domestication</h1></header>
        <p>Cats were first domesticated around 9,000 years ago in the Near East, particularly in farming communities. They were likely attracted to human settlements by the abundance of rodents feeding on stored grain. Humans recognized their usefulness in pest control and allowed them to stay. Unlike dogs, cats largely domesticated themselves by living alongside humans and slowly becoming more social and tolerant over generations.</p>

        <header><h1>Reasons You Should Own a Cat</h1></header>
        <p>Cats can offer companionship, comfort, and emotional support to their owners. Their playful and curious nature makes them entertaining to watch and interact with. They are relatively independent compared to some pets, meaning they can be left alone for longer periods.</p>
        <p>Cats do not require outdoor walks, making them suitable for people with busy lifestyles or small living spaces. Many owners find a cat’s purring and affectionate moments soothing after a stressful day.</p>

        <header><h1>Things To Know Before Owning One</h1></header>
        <p>Before adopting a cat, consider your lifestyle, time, and financial readiness. Cats require a long-term commitment, often living <code>12–18 years</code>. You will need to budget for food, litter, toys, grooming supplies, and veterinary care, including vaccinations and possible emergency treatments. They need mental and physical stimulation, so interactive play and environmental enrichment are important. You should also consider whether you can provide a safe environment, especially if you plan to keep the cat indoors only.</p>
